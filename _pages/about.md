I am a Postdoc Researcher at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I received my PhD degree in the University of New South Wales Supervised by Xuemin Lin in 2020, and received my bachelor degree from Tsinghua University in 2016. After that, I worked as a research fellow in the University of New South Wales, Australia during 2020-2021. Then, I worked as a research fellow in the Chinese University of Hong Kong Supervised by Jeffrey Xu Yu during 2021-2022.
My research interests mainly focus on the areas of path-based analysis, fraud detection, and efficient new hardware-based graph analysis over big data, particularly big graph data and dynamic graphs. Till now, I have published 14 papers in the areas of database, data mining, and most of them were published in top-tier conferences (e.g., PVLDB, ICDE) and journals (e.g., VLDBJ). I have also served as program committee members for top conference (e.g., PVLDB).
